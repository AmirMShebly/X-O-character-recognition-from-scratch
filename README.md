# X-O-character-recognition-from-scratch
This project explores pattern recognition using neural networks with a simple dataset of X and O characters arranged in a five by five grid for simplicity. I've implemented various neural network models from scratch starting from basic models to more advanced MLP models for recognizing and classifying the patterns.
